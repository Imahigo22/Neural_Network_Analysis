# Neural_Network_Analysis

Beks has been trying to use Neural Network and machine learning to try and predict the loan assessment to see if the client will be successfully funded by Alphabet Soup Corporation. We're looking to see if we can find a model that will have a high accuracy so that this will be the correct algorithym to correctly predict which loans should be accepted or denied.
-------------

For the first model, we trained the machine to look at the loans that were successful and then and scale and fit the model to predict the criteria of the successful loans and then figure out if it can see which loans should be accepted or denied.

So we figured that we should use only one layer just to see how things would work.  However, the model was unsuccessful as it has a 63% accuracy rating.  I feel like we need to keep trying and find a model that's much more accurate.

Eventually I decided to go with a neural network model that had three nodes, and 1 hidden node on layers 1 and 2, and the third one have 3 hidden nodes.  After going through and testing the nodes 200 times, unfortunately the highest I could get the accuracy is at 73%.
